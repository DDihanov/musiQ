This application is designed using the MVP pattern.
The application features a beautiful material design, and makes use of cutting-edge libraries to function, e.g.:
<ul>
	<li>RxJava2</li>
    <li>Dagger2</li>
    <li>Retrofit2</li>
    <li>RxBinding</li>
    <li>ButterKnife</li>
    <li>OkHttp</li>
    <li>Gson</li>
    <li>Glide</li>
    <li>DBFlow</li>
</ul>

The API for all the information is the LastFM API.

Other libraries include custom labels, tooltips, Calligraphy library for fonts,
and Google's support libraries.

This application is meant to be a musical library for anyone who might enjoy having a cool app, which fetches information
fast and accurate from a reliable musical site, with up-to-date information about artists, albums and songs.
The program is very versatile, because it makes use of all the features the last.fm API provides such as top artists, top songs,
top songs per artist, top artists by geographical region etc...

Recently I added scrobbling integration, so the application now scrobbles to last.fm from music players like:
<ul>
	<li>YouTube</li>
    <li>Google Play Music</li>
    <li>Spotify</li>
    <li>Pandora</li>
    <li>SoundCloud</li>
    <li>VLC</li>
    <li>and more...</li>
</ul>

Some features this app. supports:
- Search for artists and albums
- Add artists and albums to your favorites for quicker access
- Select a specific artists to view more detailed information about them like their genres, biography and albums
- Select a specific album to view detailed information about it.
- Different phones support different emojis - you will have an unique penguin mascot for your device!
- Scrobbling notifications
- Currently scrobbling track information
- Scrobble history
- 'Love track' button
- Scrobbling from cache(e.g. offline scrobbles to be scrobbled at a later point)


Features to be implemented will be:
<ul>
    <li>Ability to fetch artist events.</li>
    <li>Specific user statistics</li>
    <li>Specific user scrobbles on specific artist, track etc...</li>
    <li>Optimisations</li>
</ul>
